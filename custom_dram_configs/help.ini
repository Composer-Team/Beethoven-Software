[timing]
tCK = clock time (ns)
AL = this is additive latency (not used in DDR4, but is used in LPDDR4 and HYPERBUS)
CL = this is CAS latency (meaning the number of clock cycles between a read command and the availability of the first bit of data)
CWL = this is CAS write latency (meaning the number of clock cycles between a write command and the availability of the first bit of data)

tRCD = this is RAS to CAS delay (the number of clock cycles between a row activate and a column activate)
tRP = this is RAS precharge time (the number of clock cycles between a row precharge and a row activate)
tRAS = this is RAS active time (the number of clock cycles between a row activate and a row precharge)
tRFC = this is RAS refresh to activate cycle time (the number of clock cycles between a refresh command and a row activate)
tRFC2 = seems to be unused in code base
tRFC4 = unused
tREFI = refresh interval per rank level (the number of clock cycles between refresh commands)
tRPRE = read preamble time (the number of clock cycles between a read command and the availability of the first bit of data)
tWPRE = write preamble time (the number of clock cycles between a write command and the availability of the first bit of data)
tRRD_S = activate to activate delay (short) (the number of clock cycles between two activates)
tRRD_L = activate to activate delay (long) (the number of clock cycles between two activates)
tWTR_S = write to read delay (short) (the number of clock cycles between a write and a read)
tWTR_L = write to read delay (long) (the number of clock cycles between a write and a read)
tFAW = four activate window (the time in which four activates can occur)
tWR = write recovery time (the number of clock cycles between a write and a precharge)
tWR2 = unused
tRTP = read to precharge time (the number of clock cycles between a read and a precharge)

tCCD_S = CAS to CAS delay (short) (the number of clock cycles between two column activates. There is a distinction between short and long because the number of clock cycles between two column activates can be different depending on the bank group)
tCCD_L = CAS to CAS delay (long)
tCKE = clock enable time (the number of clock cycles between a clock enable and a clock disable)
tCKESR = clock enable self refresh time
tXS = exit self refresh time (the number of clock cycles between a self refresh and a clock enable)
tXP = exit power down time (the number of clock cycles between a power down and a clock enable)
tRTRS = read to read delay (short) (the number of clock cycles between two reads)
